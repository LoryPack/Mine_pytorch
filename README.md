# MINE: Mutual Information Neural Estimation in pytroch
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.04062.pdf

This implementation works for univariate variables, but it is easy to estend it to multivariate ones. 

Based on https://github.com/MasanoriYamada/Mine_pytorch


# FILES: 
 - neural_estimation.py -> function to run MINE and pairwise wrapper
 - plot_functions.py -> some plotting utilities
 - mine.ipynb -> some experiments on MINE
 - Kraskov_Neural_MI_comparison.ipynb -> further experiments, comparing with Kraskov Mutual Information estimation
